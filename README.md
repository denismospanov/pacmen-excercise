# PacMen Factory

<img src="images/PacMan1.png">

## Project Description
The user can populate their screen with as many PacMan characters as they desire via a dedicated button. Once toggled via a dedicated button, each PacMan will begin moving across the screen at a unique speed, bouncing off the pages' edges.

## How to Run
To run the program, begin by downloading this repository. Once installed, open index.html in a new browser tab and populate the screen with PacMen via the dedicated button. Begin the animation via the 'Start Game' button. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
First, you can add a new button to reset the animation. Other improvements can be momentarely changing the size of the PacMan when bouncing off the edge to simulate elastic collision compression.
